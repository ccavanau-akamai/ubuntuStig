# SSH Banner Acknowledgement Check Fix

## Problem Description

The STIG compliance script was incorrectly evaluating the SSH banner acknowledgement check (SV-270694r1066571_rule) as PASS when it should have been FAIL. The issue was that the script was not properly handling the case where the required file `/etc/profile.d/ssh_confirm.sh` does not exist.

## Solution Implemented

Added special handling in the `evaluate_command_result` function to properly check for the SSH banner acknowledgement script:

```bash
# Special case for SSH banner acknowledgement check
elif [[ "$command" == *"less /etc/profile.d/ssh_confirm.sh"* ]] || ([[ "$command" == *"cat /etc/profile.d/ssh_confirm.sh"* ]]); then
    if [ $exit_code -ne 0 ] || [[ "$output" == *"No such file or directory"* ]]; then
        echo "FAIL"
        echo -e "${YELLOW}SSH banner acknowledgement script not found${NC}" >&2
    elif [[ "$output" != *"You are accessing a U.S. Government (USG) Information System"* ]] || \
         [[ "$output" != *"Do you agree? [y/N]"* ]]; then
        echo "FAIL"
        echo -e "${YELLOW}SSH banner acknowledgement script does not contain the required content${NC}" >&2
    else
        echo "PASS"
    fi
```

This code specifically:
- Checks if the command is trying to access the SSH banner acknowledgement script
- Verifies that the file exists and is accessible
- If the file exists, checks that it contains the required content
- Returns FAIL with an appropriate error message if any of these checks fail

## Benefits

1. **Accurate Evaluation**: The script now correctly identifies when the SSH banner acknowledgement script is missing or does not contain the required content.

2. **Detailed Error Messages**: The script provides specific error messages about what aspect of the SSH banner acknowledgement is incorrect.

3. **Comprehensive Checking**: The solution handles both the case where the file is missing and where the file exists but does not contain the required content.

## Testing

The fix has been tested with the SSH banner acknowledgement check (SV-270694r1066571_rule) and correctly identifies:
- When the `/etc/profile.d/ssh_confirm.sh` file is missing
- When the file exists but does not contain the required DoD Notice and Consent Banner content
- When the file exists but does not prompt for user acknowledgement

## Future Considerations

1. **Creating the Required File**: A future enhancement could include a remediation script that creates the required SSH banner acknowledgement script with the correct content.

2. **More Robust Content Verification**: The current implementation checks for key phrases, but a more robust solution might use a checksum or exact string comparison.

3. **Integration with SSH Configuration**: Ensure that the SSH configuration properly sources the profile.d directory to ensure the banner acknowledgement script is executed.
